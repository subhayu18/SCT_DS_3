# SCT_DS_3 - Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Data

This project involves building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on demographic and behavioral data.

## ✅ Task Overview
> Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic or behavioural data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Created a small-scale version of the Bank Marketing dataset for offline use
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn
- Evaluated the model with accuracy and classification report
- Visualized the decision tree structure

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 📁 File List
- `task3_decision_tree.py` – Code for the classifier and visualization
- `README.md` – This file
